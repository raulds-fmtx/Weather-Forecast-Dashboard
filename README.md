# Weather-Forecast-Dashboard

## Description

A task board that enables users to create a responsive todo list built with BootStrap and jQuery UI. A user can create a task and drag & drop it into one of the three categories shown on screen. The styling of the task will change automatically depending on the due-date and category in which the task is placed. In addition, task data will be automatically saved to local storage upon creation, and will appear in their respective categories upon refreshing the page.
